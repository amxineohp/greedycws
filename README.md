Hi, this code is easy to use!

Please check the `src/train.py` for all hyper-parameter and IO settings.

You can modify the `src/train.py` to speficy your own model settings or datasets.


- For training, use the command line `python train.py`. Training details will be printed on the screen. The learned parameters will be saved in in the same directory as `train.py` *per epoch*, which will be named as `epoch1`, `epoch2`, `...`.
- For test, the ***same*** command line `python train.py` is used, but with a specified parameter file (e.g., `epoch1`), via the function argument `load_params` in `train.py` (Note `load_params` should be `None` when training). In addition, tell your test file by setting `dev_file` (Yes, when test, consider it as "test_file"). The segmented result will be saved in `src/result`.

The code is originally designed for reasearch purpose, but adaptable to industrial use.
